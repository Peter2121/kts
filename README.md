This is a fork of the KpyM Telnet/SSH Server for Windows (as I believe that project is no longer maintained).  Plans for this effort include the following:

1. Coming up with a good name
2. Removal of "registration codes" and nag screens (Done)
3. Updating cryptlib (and any other dependent libraries) to a more recent version
4. Adding proper installer/uninstaller
5. Accepting pull requests for well-coded bug fixes and feature additions

Legal Stuff Below:

This project is licensed under a standard 3-clause BSD license.  It can be found at the following address: http://www.kpym.com/2/kpym/license.txt

Because this project depends on cryptlib, any "large-scale" commercial use of it requires a commercial license from the authors of cryptlib.  The definition of "large-scale" at the time of writing this README is "company-internal purposes, or use of cryptlib in an application or product, with a total gross revenue of over US$5,000."  It is unclear at this time whether a commercial entity could download and use this project as-is within their organization without a commercial license, but I have sent a question to the authors of cryptlib to get clarification.  Until I get an "official" answer, it's your own (or your legal team's) responsibility to determine if your use requires a commercial license from cryptlib.  All that said, this seems as good a time as any to spit some legalese at you...
