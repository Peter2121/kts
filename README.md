This is a fork of the KpyM Telnet/SSH Server for Windows (as I believe that project is no longer maintained).  Plans for this effort include the following:

1. Coming up with a good name
2. Removal of "registration codes" and nag screens (Done)
3. Updating cryptlib (and any other dependent libraries) to a more recent version
4. Adding proper installer/uninstaller
